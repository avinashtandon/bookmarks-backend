Bookmarks Backend Project
This project is a Spring Boot application designed to allow users to manage their personal bookmarks. It provides a secure platform where users can sign up, log in, and save bookmarks with titles, URLs, and descriptions. The core features of the application include user authentication, role-based access control, and bookmark management.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure login and registration using Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication.
User Roles: Role-based access control allowing different permissions (e.g., standard user, admin) using user roles.
Bookmark Management: Users can add, view, edit, and delete their personal bookmarks.
MySQL Database: All user and bookmark data are persisted using a MySQL relational database.
Security: Strong encryption for passwords and secure handling of user data.
This backend is designed to be highly scalable and can be integrated with various front-end technologies to create a complete bookmarking system.
